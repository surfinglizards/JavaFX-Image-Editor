# JavaFX-Image-Editor
a small and basic image editor using JavaFX. 

This was an experiment for writable images but it worked it's way to be a small usable program. 
It's a mostly dead project now, I don't plan on updating it much since the photo editing funtions are being used by my Discord bot.

This is good for experimenting with writable images
